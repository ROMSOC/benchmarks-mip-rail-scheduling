DB Cargo Polska works with the Chair of Analytics and Mixed Integer Optimization at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg to build a prototype of a new planning tool, which would come up with locomotive schedules and driver rosters simultaneously. As of today, the industry standard is to plan locomotives and drivers separately. The reason for this is the fact that both the planning areas are challenging on their own, and -- without computational support -- it would be impossible to consider both the areas at the same time. Such fragmented approaches were criticised in the literature already in 1980s' -- see for example \cite{raff_routing_1983}. 

The purpose of the presented benchmarks is to present a set of instances, which we derived in collaboration with the industrial partner, as well as the procedures required to come up with complete Binary Programming models for these instances. In this work, we will only introduce the naive formulation of the mentioned binary models. Formulation improvements, as well as the algorithms to efficiently solve these models will be introduced in Deliverables D4.2 and D4.3.
