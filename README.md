## Benchmarks for MIP rail scheduling
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5171817.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5171817)

This benchmark provides ten test cases for integrated locomotive scheduling and driver rostering problem in rail freight. They are developed in colaboration with DB Cargo Polska S.A.

## Description
The aim of this benchmark is to provide the basis for comparison of various solution algorithms and approaches against a realistic dataset, reflecting the trains to be performed in February 2020, the available locomotives and drivers, as well as information about the compatibilit. 
All the benchmark cases are included in the ``instances`` directory. 
A step-by-step guide on how to use these benchmarks can be found in ``documentation`` directory.
